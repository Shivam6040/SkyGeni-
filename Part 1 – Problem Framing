Q.1) What do you think is the real business problem here?
Ans.1) The core problem is declining sales effectiveness, not lack of demand. Although pipeline volume is healthy, the company is:
       Converting fewer deals into wins.
       Potentially pursuing lower-quality or riskier deals.
       Lacking visibility into why deals are failing and where to intervene.

Q.2) What key questions should an AI system answer for the CRO?
Ans.2) The key questions should be- 
       - Where exactly is win rate deteriorating? Is it by industry, region, product, rep, deal size
       - Are we losing deals earlier or later in the funnel?
       - Which deals in the current pipeline are most at risk and the reason behind that?
       - Which controllable actions would improve outcomes? Like Rep coaching, better qualification, pricing or product focus?

Q.3) What metrics matter most for diagnosing win rate issues?
Ans.3) The metrics are - 
       - Stage Conversion Rate (drop-offs by stage).
       - Sales Cycle Length (won vs lost).
       - Deal Slippage Rate (deals not closing on time).
       - Win Rate by Segment (industry / product / lead source).
       - Pipeline Quality, not just volume.

Q.4) What assumptions are you making about the data or business?
Ans.4) The assumptions are - 
      - Deal stages follow a roughly consistent funnel.
      - Historical win/loss patterns are indicative of future risk.
      - Deal metadata (industry, lead source, product) meaningfully affects outcomes.
      - Sales behavior has not radically changed in the last quarter.
